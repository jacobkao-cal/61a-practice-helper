# CS 61A Practice: prototype

A no-login, browser-based practice tool for CS 61A, laid out like the Digital SAT (problem on the left, answer on the right, timer at the top right). It is seeded with questions from **Fall 2025 Midterm 2** and **Spring 2025 Midterm 2** (`mt2/`).

## Run it

There is no build step and nothing to install. Open `app/index.html` in a browser.

To serve it instead:

```sh
cd app && python3 -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

To deploy, upload the `app/` folder to any static host (Netlify drop, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

## What's in the prototype

- **Landing page:** the `assets/home_page.jpg` banner. Clicking anywhere goes to setup.
- **Setup:** dropdown menus for Topics (with question counts), Exams, Difficulty, Question types, Set size, and Timer (off, or 1–60 minutes).
- **Practice:** a split pane. Each question is a **group**: all of its parts (i, ii, iii…) are shown together on the right.
  - The left side shows the shared problem text and an **editable Python editor** (CodeMirror, dark theme, line numbers), where you can type notes, comments, or your own solution. Nothing is run.
  - **Answers fill the code:** picking a choice, or typing an answer, shows it in that part's blank right away. Selected choices are blue, typed answers green, and the active part's blank is outlined. Click a blank to jump to its part.
  - **Annotation toolbar** (top of the left pane): highlighter (select text or code), red pen (freehand), eraser (click or drag), undo/redo, and clear all (asks first). Each question keeps its own annotations.
  - Code edits and annotations are saved per problem. **Reset code** restores the original code and keeps your answers.
  - The right side shows each part in the exam's own format: **round bubbles** for "select exactly one", **square checkboxes** for "select all that apply", and a bordered answer box for written answers.
- **Grading:**
  - **Check Answer** grades the response. **Show Solution** asks for confirmation, then shows the official answer and an explanation.
  - Short answers are compared to the official answer and accepted equivalents, ignoring spaces and quote style.
  - When an answer doesn't match exactly, you can mark it right or wrong yourself.
  - Code questions (the A+ problems) are self-check only.
- **Timer:** works from timestamps, so it stays accurate across tab switches and reloads. It has pause, resume, reset, and hide. At 00:00 it shows a banner, and your answers are kept.
- **Navigator:** a "Question N of M" popover showing which questions are answered, unanswered, or marked for review. Keyboard: `←`/`→` move between questions, `M` marks for review.
- **Saving:** everything is stored in `localStorage`. The home page offers **Resume Practice** and **Start Over**.
- **Results:** counts of completed, correct, incorrect, not graded, and unanswered questions, plus time spent. You can retry the missed questions or jump back to any one.

## Files

```
app/
  index.html          page shell
  styles.css          all styling (light, exam-style)
  app.js              screens, state, timer, grading, scratch editor, persistence
  assets/             landing image
  vendor/codemirror/  CodeMirror 5.65 (bundled locally, so it works offline)
  data/questions.js   TOPICS, PROBLEMS (left-pane context), QUESTIONS, ANSWER_KEY (kept separate)
```

### Adding questions

Add a `PROBLEMS` entry (intro text, plus code with blanks written as `⟦a⟧`). A problem is one question group. Then add one `QUESTIONS` item per part (`problem` names the group, and `blank: 'a'` links the part to the `⟦a⟧` blank), and its answer in `ANSWER_KEY`:

- Multiple choice: `correct` is the index of the right choice. For select-all, it is an array of indices.
- Short answer and code: `accepted` lists the answers, with the official one first.

Topics are configured in `TOPICS`. A topic with no questions (such as Scheme) shows as "No questions yet".

## Notes and decisions

- I used plain HTML/JS instead of React/Vite so the prototype opens with a double-click. The data model follows the spec, so moving to React later only means porting the UI.
- Answer keys come from the official solution PDFs. I filled every blank with its official answer and ran the docstring tests to check the transcription.
- The PDFs had a few typos, which I corrected: `num-slices` → `num_slices`, `count-pizzas` → `count_pizzas`, `"-" + x` → `'_' + x`.
- Explanations were written for this prototype and are **not official**. Questions without one say "Explanation not yet available."
- Points for the individual blanks of Fall 2025 Q4(b) aren't listed in the exam, so they are not shown.
- **Rights:** this is an independent student project, not an official CS 61A service. Get permission from course staff before publishing exam text publicly.
